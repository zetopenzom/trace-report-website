                                        changes to the app or to charge for

                                        The Trace Report app stores and
                                        processes personal data that you
                                        have provided to us, to provide our
                                        Service. It’s your responsibility to
                                        keep your phone and access to the
                                        app secure. We therefore recommend
                                        that you do not jailbreak or root
                                        your phone, which is the process of
                                        removing software restrictions and
                                        limitations imposed by the official
                                        operating system of your device. It
                                        could make your phone vulnerable to
                                        malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                                        compromise your phone’s security
                                        features and it could mean that the
                                        Trace Report app won’t work properly
                                        or at all.

                                        certain things that KSS Group will
                                        not take responsibility for. Certain
                                        functions of the app will require
                                        the app to have an active internet
                                        connection. The connection can be
                                        Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
                                        network provider, but KSS Group
                                        cannot take responsibility for the
                                        app not working at full
                                        functionality if you don’t have
                                        access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
                                        any of your data allowance left.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        If you’re using the app outside of
                                        an area with Wi-Fi, you should
                                        remember that the terms of the
                                        agreement with your mobile network
                                        provider will still apply. As a
                                        result, you may be charged by your
                                        mobile provider for the cost of data
                                        for the duration of the connection
                                        while accessing the app, or other
                                        third-party charges. In using the
                                        app, you’re accepting responsibility
                                        for any such charges, including
                                        roaming data charges if you use the
                                        app outside of your home territory
                                        (i.e. region or country) without
                                        turning off data roaming. If you are
                                        not the bill payer for the device on
                                        which you’re using the app, please
                                        be aware that we assume that you
                                        have received permission from the
                                        bill payer for using the app.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Along the same lines, KSS Group
                                        cannot always take responsibility
                                        for the way you use the app i.e. You
                                        need to make sure that your device
                                        stays charged – if it runs out of
                                        battery and you can’t turn it on to
                                        avail the Service, KSS Group cannot
                                        accept responsibility.

                                        With respect to KSS Group’s
                                        responsibility for your use of the
                                        app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                                        important to bear in mind that
                                        although we endeavor to ensure that
                                        it is updated and correct at all
                                        times, we do rely on third parties
                                        to provide information to us so that
                                        we can make it available to you. KSS
                                        Group accepts no liability for any
                                        loss, direct or indirect, you
                                        experience as a result of relying
                                        wholly on this functionality of the
                                        app.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        At some point, we may wish to update
                                        the app. The app is currently
                                        available on Android – the
                                        requirements for the system(and for
                                        any additional systems we decide to
                                        extend the availability of the app
                                        to) may change, and you’ll need to
                                        download the updates if you want to
                                        keep using the app. KSS Group does
                                        not promise that it will always
                                        update the app so that it is
                                        relevant to you and/or works with
                                        the Android version that you have
                                        installed on your device. However,
                                        you promise to always accept updates
                                        to the application when offered to
                                        you, We may also wish to stop
                                        providing the app, and may terminate
                                        use of it at any time without giving
                                        notice of termination to you. Unless
                                        we tell you otherwise, upon any
                                        termination, (a) the rights and
                                        licenses granted to you in these
