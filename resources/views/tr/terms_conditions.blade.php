                                        carefully before using the app.
                                        You’re not allowed to copy or modify

                                        source code of the app, and you also
                                        shouldn’t try to translate the app

                                        KSS Group is committed to ensuring
                                        that the app is as useful and
                                        efficient as possible. For that
                                        reason, we reserve the right to make
                                        changes to the app or to charge for
                                        its services, at any time and for
                                        any reason. We will never charge you
                                        for the app or its services without
                                        making it very clear to you exactly
                                        what you’re paying for.

                                        The Trace Report app stores and
                                        processes personal data that you
                                        have provided to us, to provide our
                                        Service. It’s your responsibility to
                                        keep your phone and access to the
                                        app secure. We therefore recommend
                                        that you do not jailbreak or root
                                        your phone, which is the process of
                                        removing software restrictions and
                                        limitations imposed by the official
                                        operating system of your device. It
                                        could make your phone vulnerable to
                                        malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                                        compromise your phone’s security
                                        features and it could mean that the
                                        Trace Report app won’t work properly
                                        or at all.

                                        The app does use third-party

                                        You should be aware that there are
                                        certain things that KSS Group will
                                        not take responsibility for. Certain
                                        functions of the app will require
                                        the app to have an active internet
                                        connection. The connection can be
                                        Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
                                        network provider, but KSS Group
                                        cannot take responsibility for the
                                        app not working at full
                                        functionality if you don’t have
                                        access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
                                        any of your data allowance left.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        If you’re using the app outside of
                                        an area with Wi-Fi, you should
                                        remember that the terms of the
                                        agreement with your mobile network
                                        provider will still apply. As a
                                        result, you may be charged by your
                                        mobile provider for the cost of data
                                        for the duration of the connection
                                        while accessing the app, or other
                                        third-party charges. In using the
                                        app, you’re accepting responsibility
                                        for any such charges, including
                                        roaming data charges if you use the
                                        app outside of your home territory
                                        (i.e. region or country) without
                                        turning off data roaming. If you are
                                        not the bill payer for the device on
                                        which you’re using the app, please
                                        be aware that we assume that you
                                        have received permission from the
                                        bill payer for using the app.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Along the same lines, KSS Group
                                        cannot always take responsibility
                                        for the way you use the app i.e. You
                                        need to make sure that your device
                                        stays charged – if it runs out of
                                        battery and you can’t turn it on to
                                        avail the Service, KSS Group cannot
                                        accept responsibility.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        With respect to KSS Group’s
                                        responsibility for your use of the
                                        app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                                        important to bear in mind that
                                        although we endeavor to ensure that
                                        it is updated and correct at all
                                        times, we do rely on third parties
                                        to provide information to us so that
